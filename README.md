# CS422
This is my CS 422 repo so I can transfer from my PC to MAC

FOR PC:
I ran 'pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn'
pip install ucimlrepo

Maybe ill use a virtual enviornment later and also maybe ill run jupyter later idk yet

This is for virtual environment 
conda activate iris-dataset

conda deactivate
